# HappinessLinearRegression
From the Gallup World Poll, I explain how happy a country is by using the ladder score as a metric of happiness. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country. These factors explain why some countries rank higher than others which we explain by a linear regression targetting the ladder score. In this project, I utilize my econometrics knowledge. 

Our Final Model's Regression Equation is:
Ladder Score = 5.5979 - 0.8802*(Logged GDP per capita) ++ 1.3845*(Logged GDP per capita^2)+ 0.3155*(Social support) + 0.2845*(Freedom to make life choices) 

This was the 8th Model created with the best results all out of all else created. This final robust model had an R-Squared value of 82.8% and an adjusted R-Squared value of 82.1%.
